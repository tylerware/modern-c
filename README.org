* About
I'm working through the book "Modern C", which you can get from [[https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/][here]]. And this is the place I'm collecting the code examples and my thoughts as I work through the book. Probably pretty useless for anyone else, except me!

- [[file:chapters/chapter-2.org][2. The principal structure of a program]]
* Setup
